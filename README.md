# Assignment Document Dispatch Register üë©‚Äçüíºüìùüöö

Welcome to the readme file for the "Document Dispatch Register" assignment for the Software Engineering course (CS3005) at the Computer Science Department of the University of Computer & Emerging Sciences (NUCES-FAST). This document contains essential information about the assignment, its requirements, and the solution provided.

## Assignment Details üìö

- **Course Title:** Software Engineering
- **Course Code:** CS3005
- **Instructor:** Dr. Ejaz Ahmed
- **Assignment No:** HW-1 (Class)
- **Assignment Title:** Documents Dispatch Register (DDR)
- **Estimated Time:** 10 Hours

## Brief üìã

The assignment focuses on creating a Document Dispatch Register (DDR) using Agile approach principles. The goal is to track documents, manage their status and location, enable efficient searching, and provide priority handling. The assignment involves several deliverables including User Requirement Definition, System Requirements Specification, Functional Specification, User Stories, and Prototype Models/Processes.

## Solution üí°

The solution entails designing and implementing a Document Dispatch Register (DDR) system with the following features:

- Tracking documents with unique identifiers for traceability.
- Real-time recording of document locations and statuses.
- Centralized dashboard for viewing document status across the organization.
- Alerts and notifications for pending and priority documents.
- Search functionality based on various criteria, including advanced search capabilities.
- Priority levels for documents, with corresponding urgency mechanisms.
- Manual updates for document movements between departments.
- Confirmation system for receiving documents in the next department.
- Log of all document movements, statuses, timestamps, and user details.

### Functional Specification Attributes üìä

The system's functional attributes include:

- `DocId/TrackingNumber`: Unique ID for document tracking.
- `DocType`: Type of document (e.g., leave, absence justification).
- `DocStatus`: Current status of the document (e.g., under review, approved).
- `DocLocation`: Current department of the document.
- `SenderID`: ID of the document sender (student, alumni, staff).
- `SenderType`: Category of the sender (student/alumni/staff).
- `SenderName`: Name of the document sender.
- `SenderPhone`: Phone number of the sender.
- `SenderEmail`: Email of the sender.
- `DocSubmissionDate`: Date of document submission.
- `DocPath`: Departments through which the document has been processed.
- `Priority`: Indicates priority level.

### User Stories üìñ

The user stories define user requirements and expectations for the DDR system. Some examples include:

- As an administrator, I want to insert a document and have the system assign a unique ID for tracking.
- As a user, I want real-time tracking of document location and status.
- As an administrator, I need a dashboard showing document status organization-wide.
- As a user, I want to search and filter documents based on specific criteria.
- As a user, I want alerts for pending and priority documents.
- As a user, I want high-priority documents to be processed urgently.
- As a user, I need to manually update document status when moving between departments.
- As a user, I want a log of document movements and statuses.

## Screenshots üì∏
Screenshots of the implemented DDR system and its features will be done in next iteration.
